    "# Interference and Diffraction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tTo explore the diffraction of light through a variety of apertures \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tTo learn how interference can be used to measure small distances very accurately. By example we will measure the wavelength of the laser, the spacing between tracks on a CD and the thickness of human hair \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Electromagnetic radiation propagates as a wave, and as such can exhibit interference and diffraction. This is most strikingly seen with laser light, where light shining on a piece of paper looks speckled (with light and dark spots) rather than evenly illuminated, and where light shining through a small hole makes a pattern of bright and dark spots rather than the single spot you might expect from your everyday experiences with light. In this lab we will use laser light to investigate the phenomena of interference and diffraction and will see how we can use these phenomena to make accurate measurements of very small objects like the spacing between tracks on a CD and the thickness of human hair.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Details: Interference\n",
    "Figure 1 below forms the basis of all the phenomena you will observe in the lab.  Two different waves arrive at a single position in space (at the screen). If they are in phase then they add constructively and you see a bright spot.  If they are out of phase then they add destructively and you see nothing (dark spot). The key to creating interference is creating phase shift between two waves that are then brought together at a single position. A common way to do that is to add extra path length to one of the waves relative to the other.\n",

    "<center>Figure 1. Diagram of wave interference.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab the distance traveled from source to screen, and hence the relative phase of incoming waves, changes as a function of lateral position on the screen, creating a visual interference pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Slit Interference\n",
    "The first phenomenon we consider is two slit interference. Light from the laser hits two very narrow slits, which then act like in- phase point sources of light. In traveling from the slits to the screen, however, the light from the two slits travel different distances. In Fig. 2 light hitting point P from the bottom slit travels further than the light from the top slit. This extra path length introduces a phase shift between the two waves and leads to a position dependent interference pattern on the screen.\n",

    "<img src=\"./images/interference_geometry.jpg\" alt=\"Interference Geometry Diagram\" width=\"300\"><br>\n",
    "Figure 2. Geometric analysis diagram of wave interference.</center>\n",
    "Here the extra path length is $\\delta=d\\sin\\theta$, leading to a phase shift $\\phi$ given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\delta}{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\phi}{2\\pi}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Realizing that phase shifts that are multiples of $2\\pi$ give us constructive interference while odd multiples of $\\pi$ lead to destructive interference leads to the following conditions: Maxima:  $d \\sin\\theta=m\\lambda$; Minima: $d \\sin\\theta=(m+1/2)\\lambda$. The variable $m$ is an integer that indicates the number of maxima away from the central or principle maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the distance to the screen $L$ is very large compared to the separation of maxima or minima $y$ or $\\Delta y$. When this is true, $\\theta$ is small and $r\\approx L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sin\\theta = \\frac{y}{r} \\approx \\frac{y}{L}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can write that the maxima condition is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d\\frac{y}{L}\\approx m\\lambda$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "$$d\\frac{\\Delta y}{L} \\approx \\lambda$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Slit Interference\n",
    "If instead of two identical slits separated by a distance $d$ there are multiple identical slits, each separated by a distance $d$, the same effect happens. For example, at all angles $\\theta$ satisfying $d \\sin\\theta=m\\lambda$ we find constructive interference, now from all of the holes. The difference in the resulting interference pattern lies in those regions that are neither maxima or minima but rather in between. Here, because more incoming waves are available to interfere, the interference becomes more destructive, making the minima appear broader and the maxima sharper. This explains the appearance of a brilliant array of colors that change as a function of angle when looking at a CD or DVD. A CD has a large number of small grooves, each reflecting light and becoming a new source like a small slit. For a given angle, a distinct set of wavelengths will form constructive maxima when the reflected light reaches your eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diffraction\n",
    "\n",
    "The next kind of interference we consider is light going through a single slit, interfering with itself. This is called diffraction, and arises from the finite width of the slit ($a$ in Figure 3). The resultant effect is not nearly as easy to derive as that from two-slit interference (which, as you can see from above, is straight-forward). The result for the angular locations of the **minima** are\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$$\n",

    "Figure 3. Geometric analysis diagram of diffraction.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Putting it Together\n",
    "If you have two wide slits, that is, slits that exhibit both diffraction and interference, the pattern observed on a distant screen is as follows in Fig. 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Interference and Diffraction Diagram](./images/interference_diffraction.jpg)\n",
    "<center>Figure 4. Interference from two slits and diffraction from each slit combined.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the amplitude modulation (the red envelope) is set by the diffraction (the width of the slits), while the “individual wiggles” are due to the interference between the light coming from the two different slits. You know that this must be the case because d must be larger than $a$, and hence the minima locations, which go like $1/d$, are closer together for the two slit pattern than for the single slit pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Opposite of a Slit: Babinet’s Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have discussed sending light through very narrow slits or reflecting it off of small grooves, in each case creating a series of point-like “new sources” of light that can then go on and interfere. Rather amazingly, light hitting a small solid object, like a piece of hair, creates the same interference pattern as if the object were replaced with a hole of the same dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is Babinet’s Principle, and the reason behind it is summed up by Fig. 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./images/babinet.png\" alt=\"Babinet's Principle Diagram\" width=\"400\"/><br>\n",
    "Figure 5. A diagram of Babinet's Principle.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you add an object to a hole of the same size, you get a filled hole. EM waves hitting those objects must add in the same fashion, that is, the electric fields produced when light hits the hole, when added to the electric fields produced by the small object, must add to the electric fields produced when light hits the filled hole. Since no light can get through the filled hole, Ehole + Eobject = 0. Thus, we find that the electric fields coming out of the hole are equal and opposite to the electric fields diffracting off of the small object. Since the observed interference pattern depends on intensity, the square of the electric field, the hole and the object will generate identical diffraction patterns. By measuring properties of the diffraction pattern we can thus measure the width of the small object. In this lab the small object will be a piece of your hair. \n",

    "## General Procedure\n",
    "In this lab you will shine the light through slits, across hairs or off of CDs and make measurements of the resulting interference pattern.\n",
