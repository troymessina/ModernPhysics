Using plots of current vs. voltage and assuming Planck's hypothesis that photons have energy $hc/\\lambda$, we will determine the wavelength of light emitted from an LED. We will using a DC power supply connected to a resistor and LED series circuit to collect voltage data on the LED-resistor voltage divider circuit as seen in Figure 1.

You will measure the voltage output of the DC power supply and the voltage across the LED. Record the known resistance and its uncertainty in the cell below. We can approximate the voltage needed to illuminate an LED using Planck's hypothesis. In the code cell below, calculate the photon energy in electron volts for blue (400 nm), greed (500 nm), yellow (600 nm), and red (650 nm) photons. Electron-volts are a funny unit. We can divide by $e$ to get Volts. On the other side of the Planck energy equation, dividing by $e$ simply changes the units from Joules to electron-Volts. Therefore, we can use units as described below to calculate the LED energies in eV.\n",
