It is recommended that you rearrange equation (3) in the manual so that you can plot the dependent variable (radius of the electron beam, $r$) vs. the independent variable, either the square root of voltage ($V^{1/2}$) or the reciprocal of the magnetic field ($1/B$). This will make the slope of your graph contain $e/m$.\n",
